abstract = {This is a lecture video about a short article by Amy Kind, wherein she explains David Chalmers' famous Zombie argument against physicalism. A "zombie" is a philosophical term for a creature that is micro-physically identical to a normal human being, but who doesn't have any consciousness. The argument, briefly and roughly, is that such a creature seems conceivable, which means that such a creature is metaphysically possible. If zombies are possible, then consciousness cannot be identical with any physical state of affairs, meaning that physicalism is false. This video lecture is part of an introductory philosophy course.},

@article{Clark1998,
abstract = {The extended mind thesis (EMT) claims that the cognitive processes that make up the human mind can reach beyond the boundaries of individual to include as proper parts aspects of the individual's physical and sociocultural environment. Proponents of the extended mind story thus hold that even quite familiar human mental states (such as states of believing that so-and-so) can be realized, in part, by structures and processes located outside the human head. Such claims go far beyond the important, but less challenging, assertion that human cognizing leans heavily on various forms of external scaffolding and support. Instead, they paint mind itself (or better, the physical machinery that realizes some of our cognitive processes and mental states) as, under humanly attainable conditions, extending beyond the bounds of skin and skull. Extended cognition in its most general form occurs when internal and external resources become fluently tuned and deeply integrated in such a way as to enable a cognitive agent to solve problems and accomplish their projects, goals, and interests. Consider, for instance, how technological resources such as pens, paper, and personal computers are now so deeply integrated into our everyday lives that we couldn't accomplish many of our cognitive goals and purposes without them. The extended mind thesis claims that technological resources have become so thoroughly enmeshed with our internal cognitive machinery that they now count as part of the machinery of thought itself. Underlying (but distinct from) the extended mind thesis is a commonplace observation thatintelligent problem solving of the kind we find in adult humans isn't something the naked brain can achieve all on its own, but is instead the outcome of the brain and body operating together in an environmental and often technologically loaded setting. As humans, we possess the kinds of high-level cognitive skills and abilities we do in no small part because of the many tools we use for thinking. The extended mind thesis goes further, however, by claiming that it is mere prejudice to suppose that all cognition must take place within the confines of the organism's skin and skull. Cognitive science, it is then claimed, shouldn't only concern itself with the more or less enduring processes taking place inside the heads of cognitive agents. Cognitive scientists should also investigate, on a kind of equal footing, temporary, soft-assembled wholes that mesh the problem-solving contributions of the brain and nervous system with the body and physical and sociocultural environment.},

abstract = {What is consciousness? As the physical processes in the brain give rise to the self - conscious mind and feelings so deeply varied as love or hate, aesthetic pleasure or spiritual yearning ? These questions are now among the most debated issues among scientists and philosophers , and we have seen in recent years superb volumes by eminent figures as Francis Crick , Daniel C. Dennett , Gerald Edelman , and Roger Penrose , all firing volleys in what has come to be called the consciousness wars . Now , in the conscious mind , philosopher David J. Chalmers offers a cogent analysis of this debate as it reveals a major new theory of consciousness that rejects the prevailing reductionist trend of science , offering provocative ideas about the relationship between mind and brain . Writing in a rigorous thought-provoking style, the author takes us on a tour through the far-reaching philosophical implications of consciousness. Chalmers convincingly reveals how contemporary cognitive science and neurobiology have failed to explain how and why mental events emerge from physiological occurrences in the brain . He proposes instead that conscious experience must be understood in an entirely new light - as an irreducible entity (similar to such physical properties as time , mass , and space) that exists at a fundamental level , and can not be understood as the sum of its parts . And after suggesting some intriguing possibilities about the structure and laws of conscious experience , he details how his unique reinterpretation of the mind could be the focus of a new science . Throughout the book , Chalmers provides fascinating thought experiments that trenchantly illustrate his ideas . For example , in exploring the notion that consciousness could be experienced by machines as well as humans , Chalmers asks us to imagine a thinking brain in which neurons are slowly replaced by silicon chips that precisely duplicate their functions - how neurons are replaced , will consciousness gradually fade away? The book also features thoughtful discussions of how the author's theories can be practically applied to subjects as diverse as artificial intelligence and interpretation of quantum mechanics . We have all pondered the nature and meaning of consciousness. Engaging and penetrating, the conscious mind adds a new perspective to the subject that is sure to spark debate about our understanding of mind for years to come . O que {\'{e}} a consci{\^{e}}ncia? Como os processos f{\'{i}}sicos no c{\'{e}}rebro dar lugar {\`{a}} mente auto-consciente e sentimentos t{\~{a}}o profundamente variados como amor ou {\'{o}}dio, prazer est{\'{e}}tico ou anseio espiritual? Essas perguntas hoje est{\~{a}}o entre as quest{\~{o}}es mais debatidas entre os cientistas e fil{\'{o}}sofos, e temos visto nos {\'{u}}ltimos anos excelentes volumes por figuras eminentes como Francis Crick, Daniel C. Dennett, Gerald Edelman, e Roger Penrose, todos os voleios de tiro em que tem veio a ser chamado as guerras consci{\^{e}}ncia. Agora, na mente consciente, fil{\'{o}}sofo David J. Chalmers oferece uma an{\'{a}}lise convincente deste debate como ele revela uma nova e importante teoria da consci{\^{e}}ncia, que rejeita a tend{\^{e}}ncia reducionista predominante da ci{\^{e}}ncia, oferecendo id{\'{e}}ias provocativas sobre a rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o entre mente e c{\'{e}}rebro. Escrevendo em um estilo instigante rigoroso, o autor nos leva em uma turn{\^{e}} de grande alcance atrav{\'{e}}s das implica{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es filos{\'{o}}ficas da consci{\^{e}}ncia. Chalmers convincente revela como contempor{\^{a}}nea a ci{\^{e}}ncia cognitiva ea neurobiologia n{\~{a}}o conseguiram explicar como e por que os eventos mentais emergem de ocorr{\^{e}}ncias fisiol{\'{o}}gicas no c{\'{e}}rebro. Ele prop{\~{o}}e vez que a experi{\^{e}}ncia consciente deve ser entendida sob uma luz inteiramente nova - como uma entidade irredut{\'{i}}vel (semelhante a propriedades f{\'{i}}sicas tais como o tempo, em massa, e espa{\c{c}}o) que existe a um n{\'{i}}vel fundamental, e n{\~{a}}o pode ser entendida como a soma das suas partes . E depois de sugerir algumas possibilidades intrigantes sobre a estrutura e as leis da experi{\^{e}}ncia consciente, ele detalha como sua reinterpreta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o {\'{u}}nica da mente poderia ser o foco de uma nova ci{\^{e}}ncia. Ao longo do livro, Chalmers fornece experimentos mentais fascinantes que incisivamente ilustrar suas id{\'{e}}ias. Por exemplo, em explorar a no{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de que a consci{\^{e}}ncia poderia ser experimentado por m{\'{a}}quinas, assim como os seres humanos, Chalmers nos pede para imaginar um c{\'{e}}rebro a pensar em que os neur{\^{o}}nios est{\~{a}}o lentamente substitu{\'{i}}das por chips de sil{\'{i}}cio que, precisamente duplicar as suas fun{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es - como os neur{\^{o}}nios s{\~{a}}o substitu{\'{i}}dos, vai consci{\^{e}}ncia gradualmente desaparecer? O livro tamb{\'{e}}m apresenta discuss{\~{o}}es pensativo de como as teorias do autor pode ser aplicado praticamente a temas t{\~{a}}o diversos como a intelig{\^{e}}ncia artificial ea interpreta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da mec{\^{a}}nica qu{\^{a}}ntica. Todos n{\'{o}}s j{\'{a}} ponderou sobre a natureza eo significado da consci{\^{e}}ncia.

In this paper, I first isolate the truly hard part of the problem, separating it from more tractable parts and giving an account of why it is so difficult to explain. I critique some recent work that uses reductive methods to address consciousness, and argue that such methods inevitably fail to come to grips with the hardest part of the problem. Once this failure is recognized, the door to further progress is opened. In the second half of the paper, I argue that if we move to a new kind of nonreductive explanation, a naturalistic account of consciousness can be given. I put forward my own candidate for such an account: a nonreductive theory based on principles of structural coherence and organizational invariance, and a double-aspect theory of information.},

abstract = {In this paper, by analyzing the Chalmers-Searle debate about Chalmers' zombie thought experiment, I attempt to determine the implications that the irreducibility of consciousness has for the truth of materialism. While Chalmers claims that the irreducibility of consciousness forces us to embrace dualism, Searle claims that it has no deep metaphysical import and, in particular, that it is fully consistent with his materialist theory of mind. I argue that this disagreement hinges on the notion of physical identity in play in the discussion. Clarifying this notion in turn helps to clarify what it means to claim that consciousness is irreducible, and provides insight into the implications that the truth of this claim would have for the dualism-materialism debate. Ultimately, I suggest that the sort of irreducibility that can be motivated by the zombie thought experiment is not sufficient to require the rejection of materialism.},

The modern philosopher Chalmers says that answering why some physical processes in the brain (body) are accompanied by experience, and why a given physical process generates a specific experience for example, experience of red or green is the "hard problem" of consciousness. Consciousness, the mind, the body, and their relations were thoroughly analyzed in the Indian philosophy (Vedanta) of ancient times.

High AQ adults maintained a consistent advantage in search speed across diverse target-distracter stimulus conditions. This advantage may reflect enhanced local processing of curvature in early stages of the form vision pathway and superior global detection of shape primitives. However, more probable is the presence of a superior search process that enables a consistent search advantage at both levels of processing.},
